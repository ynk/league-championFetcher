## Web App Update

### v0.1-beta

Time to be big boy.
Refer to this part of the readme on how to run this web app.

### How to run

* Open a python virtualenv using the following command (Or if you already know what you are doing)

``` markdown
virtualenv --python=python3 ~/.virtualenv/your_virtualenv_name
```

* Now Activate your environment

``` markdown
 source ~/.virtualenv/your_virtualenv_name/bin/activate
```

* Now Install all requirements from your project file.

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Lets start this app. (Run this command from the project directory). This will start the project on port 8080 (or any port you want).
  
  **Make sure you are on the root directory of the project when you run the following command**

```  bash
gunicorn --workers=10 --worker-class=gevent "app:create_app()" --bind=0.0.0.0:8080 --timeout 300
```

--workers command will create 10 processes to handle multiple request
--worker-class gevent will handle all the request asynchronously
--bind 0.0.0.0:8080 will bind the app. (self explanatory!)
--timeout 300 (self explanatory!)

This will be the output

```  bash
[2019-07-21 11:15:55 +0600] [8077] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0
[2019-07-21 11:15:55 +0600] [8077] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080 (8077)

[2019-07-21 11:15:55 +0600] [8089] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 8089
[2019-07-21 11:15:56 +0600] [8091] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 8091
[2019-07-21 11:15:56 +0600] [8092] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 8092
[2019-07-21 11:15:56 +0600] [8094] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 8094
```

* Now it's your job to port your server to connect with port 8080 (or any other port). For testing purpose,
check http://0.0.0.0:8080
* timeout 300 command will keep the connection open as long as 5 minutes aka 300 seconds.
